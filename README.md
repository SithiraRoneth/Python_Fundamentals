# Python Fundamentals Repository

Welcome to the **Python Fundamentals** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide to the foundational concepts of Python programming. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository provides clear examples and explanations of essential Python concepts.

## ðŸ“š Contents
This repository covers the following fundamental Python topics:

1. **Functions**  
   Learn how to define and call reusable blocks of code using Python functions. Includes examples of parameterized functions and return statements.

2. **Python Collections**  
   Understand Python's built-in collection types:
   - **List**: Ordered, mutable, and allows duplicates.
   - **Tuple**: Ordered, immutable, and allows duplicates.
   - **Set**: Unordered, mutable, and does not allow duplicates.
   - **Dictionary**: Key-value pairs, mutable, and unordered.

3. **Loops**  
   Dive into iterative structures:
   - `for` loops for iterating over sequences.
   - `while` loops for executing code while a condition is true.

4. **Operators**  
   Explore Python's operators:
   - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.).
   - Relational operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.).
   - Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
   - Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, etc.).

5. **Range Function**  
   Understand how to use the `range()` function to generate sequences of numbers for use in loops and other contexts.

6. **Switch Case (via Dictionaries)**  
   Since Python does not have a native `switch-case` statement, this section demonstrates how to implement similar functionality using dictionaries.

7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   Master the core OOP concepts in Python:
   - Classes and Objects
   - Encapsulation
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
