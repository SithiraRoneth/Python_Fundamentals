#Library management system
#You are tasked with creating a basic library management system using inheritance. Implement the following classes.
#   1. Base class- LibraryItem
#       Attributes-title(string), author(string), publication_year(int) 
#       Method - display_info() - print the details of the item
#   2. Derived class- Book   It inherits from LibraryItem
#       Additional attributes - genre(string),isbm(string)
#       Override display_info() - print the details including the genre and isbm
#   3. Derived class - Magazine     It inherits from LibraryItem
#       Additional attributes - issue(string) 
#       Override display_info() - print the details including the issue
#   Task - Create instances of each class(Book,Magazine) with appropriate values for their attributes
#   Call the diplay_info() method for each instance to test inherit inheritance and method overriding
